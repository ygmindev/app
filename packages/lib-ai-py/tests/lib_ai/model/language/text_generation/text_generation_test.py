        On 3 December 2024, at 22:27 Korea Standard Time (KST), Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, declared martial law during a televised address.
        In his declaration, Yoon accused the Democratic Party (DPK), which has a majority in the National Assembly, of conducting "anti-state activities" and collaborating with "North Korean communists" to destroy the country, thereby creating a "legislative dictatorship".
        The order prohibited political activities, including gatherings of the National Assembly and local legislatures, and suspended the free press.
        Separately, Yoon reportedly ordered the arrest of various political opponents, including the leaders of the DPK and his own People Power Party (PPP).
        This event was widely characterized by Korean politicians and news organizations, both international and domestic, as an attempted self-coup.
