"The Slouchy V-Neck Why is it key? Slouchy, oversized and boxy silhouettes continue to drive casual V-neck styles, in line with the growing desire for a cosy, comfortable wardrobe that reassuringly envelops the wearer for A/W. A recognisable knitwear shape ripe for a youthful update, the #countrycalling trend weâ€™re tracking is reworking classic patterns in larger scales. #Supersizedintarsia argyle motifs are a bold and contemporary example.
Design details: use 5gg yarn, ensuring a deep V-neckline and raglan sleeves to heighten the slouchy look. Knit in sustainable brushed super-kid mohair yarn for a cosy, soft finish, using a palette of earthy greens and grey tones."
